# Patterns Discovered

Learnings from using Project Creator that should inform future templates and command improvements.

---

## Purpose

As projects go through seeding, patterns emerge:
- Questions that always need to be asked
- Context that's always needed
- Structures that work well
- Command friction that should be fixed

Document these here. When a pattern appears **3+ times**, consider formalizing it as a template or command update.

## Command Improvements

Friction or failures observed in commands, and proposed fixes.

| Command | Issue Observed | Proposed Fix | Status |
|---------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| | | | |

---

## Recurring Questions

Questions that come up in every `/intake` session — candidates for structured capture.

| Question | Why It Matters | Frequency |
|----------|---------------|-----------|
| | | |

---

## Project Archetypes

Patterns in the types of projects being created — candidates for templates.

| Archetype | Characteristics | Example Projects |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| | | |

---

## Context Patterns

Structures or documents that consistently prove useful.

| Pattern | What It Captures | When to Use |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|

# Session Rules (Injected Every Session + Post-Compaction)

1. Check for applicable skills BEFORE responding to any task.
2. Execute skill steps in order as written. Follow the specification exactly.
3. Declare collected values between phases before proceeding.
4. Build complete prompts with actual values (no placeholders) when invoking agents.
5. Verify file existence after agent claims completion.
6. Skills dispatch agents; agents preload reference skills. Follow the three-layer architecture.

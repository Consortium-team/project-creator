# CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION
# =============================================================================
# All client work happens in projects/ - this folder is NEVER committed.
# Tracking contains references to active client projects - also NEVER committed.
# This ensures client names, project details, and work products stay private.
# =============================================================================

# Client projects - each has its own independent git repo
# This is the PRIMARY confidentiality protection
projects/

# Project tracking - contains client/project references and activity logs
tracking/

# Project ideas - may contain proprietary or confidential concepts
project-ideas/

# Private project types - proprietary type accelerators not for public release
project-types/private/

# Reference projects in public types - these reference private project paths
# that won't exist for other users. Each user builds their own over time.

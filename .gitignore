# CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY PROTECTION
# =============================================================================
# All client work happens in companions/ - this folder is NEVER committed.
# Tracking contains references to active client companions - also NEVER committed.
# This ensures client names, companion details, and work products stay private.
# =============================================================================

# Companion projects - each has its own independent git repo
# This is the PRIMARY confidentiality protection
companions/

# Legacy projects directory (migrated to companions/ by /configure)
projects/

# Project tracking - contains client/companion references and activity logs
tracking/

# Project ideas - may contain proprietary or confidential concepts
project-ideas/

# that won't exist for other users. Each user builds their own over time.
